# Cricket App (CLI)

A cricket related python program that uses APIs to performs functions
related to cricket (like live score of matches, upcoming schedules,
ICC rankings, ICC standings in current tournaments and Latest News etc.)


**PS:** Code is not as much efficient as it should ðŸ¥º, because it was my first Python Project, but it works.
One more thing, as this app is working on free so you can only send 100 requests per day. You may purchase the Paid Version of API and then change the tokens.
[Here](https://rapidapi.com/cricketapilive/api/cricbuzz-cricket/) is the link to API.

### Here's the screenshot (PS: it can do more than that ðŸ™ƒ):
